    "# Step 1: Navier-Stokes solver for Lid-driven flow in rectangular cavity\n",
    "\n",
    "This iPython notebook shows how to solve the lid-driven cavity problem with a Navier-Stokes solver. The main features are summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in two dimensions with primitive variables p, u and v and constant material properties\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocities and Neumann boundary conditions for the pressure, except for a fixed point in the lower left (SW) corner\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explicit projection method to decouple pressure and velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finite Difference discretization on a uniform orthogonal cartesian grid, first order explicit Euler time-stepping\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pressure defined in cell centers and velocities defined in backward staggered grid\n",
    "\n",
    "* Second derivatives discretized with centered differences, even for the non-linear terms in the momentum equation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Viscous term in momentum equation is calculated implicitly\n",
    "\n",
    "* Poisson equations for pressure and implicit viscous momentum term are solved with a direct solver or alternatively with an iterative solver and a multigrid preconditioner\n",

    "## Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are given in vector notation with the velocity vector $u$, the time $t$, the density $\\rho$, the pressure $p$, the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ and the Nabla operator $\\nabla$.\n",

    "The physical problem is a rectangular cavity with a moving lid as depicted in the figure below. The width and height of the cavity are $L_x=L_y=1\\,\\text{m}$. The top lid is a non-slip wall and it is moving with a velocity $u=1\\,\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}}$ in positive $x$-direction. All other boundarys are stationary non-slip walls with zero velocities. The pressure gradient is $\\vec{n}\\cdot\\nabla p=0$ at all four boundarys as it is common for non-slip walls. Finally, the pressure is set to a constant value $p=0$ at the lower left corner to completely define the pressure boundary and to obtain a positive definite coefficient matrix.\n",
