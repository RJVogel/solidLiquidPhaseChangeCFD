# solidLiquidPhaseChangeCFD
Basic CFD simulation and learning platform for thermally driven fluid flow and solid-liquid phase change problems

The starting point is a code based on the famous online course "12 steps to Navier Stokes" by Lorena Barba (https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython).

The idea is to extend the code to thermally driven fluid flow in a rectangular cavity and then to solid-liquid phase change problems.
