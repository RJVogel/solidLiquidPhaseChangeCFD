# solidLiquidPhaseChangeCFD
Basic CFD simulation of thermally driven fluid flow and solid-liquid phase change problems

The initial code for solving the Navier-Stokes equations in this tutorial is based on the online course "12 steps to Navier Stokes" by Lorena Barba (https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython).

## Three steps to solid-liquid phase change

The starting point is a code for the lid-driven cavity flow problem similar to the one by Lorena Barba cited above. The idea is to firstly extend the code to thermally driven fluid flow in a rectangular cavity and secondly to solid-liquid phase change problems.
