# solidLiquidPhaseChangeCFD

This is a minimalistic CFD code for solid liquid phase change problems.

I learned a lot about CFD and coding in Python with the incredibly well made online course "12 steps to Navier Stokes" by Lorena Barba (http://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/).
