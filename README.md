# solidLiquidPhaseChangeCFD
Basic CFD simulation of thermally driven fluid flow and solid-liquid phase change problems

How to write a basic solver for the Navier-Stokes equations written in Python is brilliantly explained in the online course "12 steps to Navier Stokes" by Lorena Barba (https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython). Here, we will continue with the lid-driven cavity flow problem and extend it to thermally driven fluid flow (natural convection) and solid-liquid phase change.

## Three steps to solid-liquid phase change

The starting point is a code for the lid-driven cavity flow problem similar to the one by Lorena Barba cited above. However, I further introduced an upwind-discretization, ... .
